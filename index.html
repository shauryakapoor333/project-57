      <p id="wl">My hobby is reading. I always read before going to bed or any freetime I get. I usually read fiction books more than non-fiction books. Usually I read one series at a time. Reading all the books takes me to a new world! Worlds with magic, dragons, my favourite charecters, places,mazes and lots more. Its a world where you can open your mind and unleash your creativety. Some books also have movies which I watch. But the books usually improve in a lot of things like vocabulary, imagination and createivety.</p>
